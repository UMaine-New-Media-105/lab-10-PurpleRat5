Lab #10 for NMD105, Made by Caleb Cholod
This project is an attempt to recreate the frogger video game in p5js.
The project uses classes, arrays, functions, loops, key presses and some other methods in order to create the game
The game has a tiger that is trying to avoid the red cars and get across the lanes using the yellow moving platforms
